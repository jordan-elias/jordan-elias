# Welcome to My GitHub


Hello! I'm Jordan, here on my GitHub, you'll find a range of projects exploring the intersection of technology, art, and science.

## üå± Current Learning Focus
- **FastAPI:** I'm actively exploring FastAPI to build more robust and efficient APIs for creating and managing databases.
- **TensorFlow:** With TensorFlow, I am building skills with deep learning and neural networks. I'm particularly interested in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Reinforcement Learning, and Time Series Analysis.


## üöÄ My Interests

- **Data Science:** With data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, new insightcs come from the story they tell.
- **Audio Processing:** I'm fascinated by sound, its analysis and manipulation, and I love to find new ways to explore this.
- **Generative Music AI:** I'm excited about experimenting with AI-driven music composition. I'm curious about perceptions of the listener and how stochastic processes can be incorporated into music-making.
- **Cognitive Neuroscience:** I'm pursuing a Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience, broadening my understanding of the human mind and its processes. I'm particularly interested in exploring the parallels between the brain and technology.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pinned Projects

Discover some of my most recent projects:

1. [Database Management with FastAPI](https://github.com/jordan-elias/database_management): A basic FastAPI application with a SQLAlchemy database backend. This can be used to access and update a client database with the option to add new clients, items, or transactions.
2. [Song classification](https://github.com/jordan-elias/Song-Classification): A decision tree and logistic regression that predict song genres using song metadata.


Feel free to explore and collaborate on any of these projects!
